# Metamaterial Design and Simulation
The metamaterial software is implemented in Matlab. After downloading/cloning the repository, you can run the Metamaterial Designer file to start designing and simulating your sparsely actuated metamaterial. The walkthrough of the design and simulation user interface can be found in our TEI'25 paper or in the supplementary file (to be added soon).
